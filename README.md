I have made a dynamic tableau dashboard where the sales director can access to the large database and findout where the business is declining. The dashboard also provides all the necessary insights about the company.
Connects to Mysql database 
Visualizes data by:
- Revenue Breakdown by cities
- Revenue breakdown by years and months
- Top 5 customers by Revenue and Sales Quantity
- Top 5 products by Revenue
- Supports interactive filtering
